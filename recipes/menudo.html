    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It’s not surprising that some of the most famous Filipino dishes have a vibrant-tasting, thick sauce or stew. These bank on some of the best seasonings and spices, as we have a good deal of them in our home court. That, and we have a great supply of some of the best vegetables to pair them with. Menudo is just one of many recipes that involves this celebration of flavors. With a savory stew that complements a variety of components— from meat to potatoes to green peas— we are able to taste richness from each added ingredient.</p>
